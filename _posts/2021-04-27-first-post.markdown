## And so it begins...

I started this fitness and nutrition blog as a tool to help myself. I've spent most of the last year --  which has been blighted by the pandemic -- feeling increasingly below par. I feel weak, tired, unfit, and completely out of shape. I know that I need to make a lot of improvement in my day-to-day lifestyle. I'm hoping that this blog is a way to get excited about the forward steps I take in terms of exercising and eating better.
